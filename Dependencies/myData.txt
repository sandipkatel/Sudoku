ABOUT
Sudoku is a popular  number  puzzle game that
involves  logic and  deduction. The objective
of  the  game  is  to  fill  a 9x9 grid  with digits
so that each column, each  row, and each of the
nine 3x3 subgrids (also known as regions or boxes)
contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle
starts with some cells already filled in, and the
player's task is to logically deduce the value of the
remaining cells to complete the grid.
